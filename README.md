# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor code for Steve's research on the stock market over the last few years, to make the VBA Script for the green_stocks spreadsheet run faster, by making the code more efficient. 

## Results
Refactoring the code did make it run a little faster. Before I refactored it, the code took about 0.53 seconds to run. After refactoring it and running it a few times, it took about 0.3 seconds to run.
